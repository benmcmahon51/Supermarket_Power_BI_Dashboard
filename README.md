## Data:
The dataset used for this project consists of information related to supermarket sales, including variables such as sales trends, revenue, product lines, customer types, and more.

## Visualization Goals:
### Key Metrics and Trends:
1. Overall sales trend over a three month period
2. Revenue for each supermarket branch
3. Product line performance
4. Member and non-member customer distribution

### Customer Behavior and Insights:
5. Peak hours for shoppers at stores

### Sales and Profitability:
6. Total gross income
7. Total units sold
8. Customer traffic and store activity
9. Average profit margin

## Visualization Methods:
A variety of visualization techniques were utilized, including line graphs, clustered bar graphs, donut charts, gauges, and cards, to effectively display the data. Power BI slicers were incorporated to dynamically filter the data, providing an interactive and informative user experience.

## Conclusion:
The following deductions were produced from dashboard data visualizations:
* Branch C was the highest performing branch in terms of total income and average customer reviews.
* Branches A and B had very similar performance reviews, with branch B having slightly lower customer reviews and total products sold.
* Food and Beverage sales accounted for the highest revenue at $2.67K over the three month period.
* Peak customer traffic hours are between 2PM and 7PM.
  
The visualizations created in this project provided valuable insights into various aspects of supermarket sales, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of sales trends, customer behavior, and profitability.
